**My Answer**
1. Basic
* Item price: including both the original price and promotional price
* Item location
* Point of sale (POS): Use barcode to keep track on it
* Demographic data: population, gender, transportation

2. Influence factors
* Any Promotion going on: including the promotions from the grocery stores and manufacturers
* Other competitors: is there any other promotion going on from other retailers?
